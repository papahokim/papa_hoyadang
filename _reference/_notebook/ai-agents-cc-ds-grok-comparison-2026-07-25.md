# Comparative Note on Three Terminal Agents  
### Claude Code (`cc`), Aider + DeepSeek (`ds`), and Grok CLI (`grok`)

**Date:** 2026-07-25  
**Context:** Termux → proot Ubuntu workstation (no local GPU)  
**Stack aliases:** `cc` · `ds` · `grok`  
**Register:** Analytic comparison for practical selection, not marketing

---

## 1. Abstract

This note compares three agent entry points used on the same phone-based Linux environment. Although **`cc` and `ds` often share a DeepSeek backend**, they are not interchangeable: one is a broad agentic workbench (Claude Code), the other a lean edit–test–commit loop (Aider). **`grok`** is a separate product tier (SuperGrok / xAI), stronger on multimodal generation, live research tooling, and parallel agent breadth, while remaining subject to weekly usage pools rather than “unlimited” access.

The practical conclusion is **role separation**, not a single winner: use **`cc` for wide orchestration**, **`ds` for cheap tight coding loops**, and **`grok` for vision, media, and agent-plus-research sessions**—especially when local GPU is unavailable.

## 2. What Each Alias Actually Launches

| Alias | Surface tool | Typical model path | Entry (Termux) |
|-------|----------------|--------------------|----------------|
| **`cc`** | Claude Code (TUI agent) | DeepSeek via Anthropic-compatible base URL | `cc` |
| **`ds`** | Aider (CLI coding pair) | `deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro` | `ds` |
| **`grok`** | Grok CLI / Build agent | SuperGrok subscription models | `grok` |

Related: `groklogin` (device auth), `grokc` (continue session), `agent` (headless Grok agent). Legacy `gr` / `grlogin` / `grc` remain as compatibility aliases.

## 3. Master Comparison Table

| Dimension | **`cc`** (Claude Code + DeepSeek) | **`ds`** (Aider + DeepSeek) | **`grok`** (Grok CLI / SuperGrok) |
|-----------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Primary strength** | Broad agent: tools, MCP, docs, GitHub, Telegram workflows | Tight coding loop: edit → run → commit | Speed, multimodal (image/video), live research, parallel agents |
| **Best when…** | Multi-step project work, repo navigation, automation, reporting | Small-to-medium code changes, iterative refactors, low ceremony | Prototypes, UI/media drafts (~80% mock quality), web crawl/research + act |
| **Weaker when…** | You only need a few file edits; permission flags feel heavy | You need deep multi-tool orchestration or non-code deliverables | Ultra-deep single-repo reasoning vs top Claude Max; weekly pool burns fast |
| **UX model** | Full agent TUI (“engineering teammate”) | Pair-programmer CLI | Full product suite in CLI/TUI (chat, build, imagine) |
| **Cost shape** | Often $0 if routed to DeepSeek API keys | Same DeepSeek cost profile; usually thrifty | ~₩45,000/mo SuperGrok; weekly shared usage pool |
| **Multimodal** | Limited vs Grok Imagine | Not the point | Strong: image/UI, video (check watermark policy) |
| **Research / crawl** | Good with tools/MCP if wired | Minimal by design | Strong community claim for speed + agentic web use; Perplexity still wins pure citation UX for many |
| **Autonomy / agents** | Subagents, hooks, skills, MCP ecosystem | Session-focused coding agent | Parallel agents, Build workflows, headless `agent` |
| **Risk profile** | Powerful with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`—needs trust & review | Lower surface area; still can rewrite code aggressively | Usage limits; media policy (watermark); not unlimited |
| **GPU dependency** | None (cloud model) | None | None—major value if you lack a GPU for local diffusion |

## 4. When Each Has a Clear Advantage

### 4.1 Prefer **`cc`** when
- The task spans **code + docs + git + notifications** (e.g. implement, document, push, Telegram report).
- You need **MCP / phone control / multi-tool** orchestration on this workstation.
- You want **structured agent habits** (project rules, hooks, subagents) rather than a thin chat loop.
- Depth of planning across a **messy multi-file repo** matters more than raw generation speed.

**Trade-off:** Heavier process; overkill for “change three lines and commit.”

### 4.2 Prefer **`ds`** when
- The job is **code-centric and iterative**: fix tests, rename, small features, git-aware patches.
- You want **minimum ceremony** and a familiar Aider loop.
- You are **budget- and latency-sensitive** on DeepSeek without spinning up a full Claude Code session.
- You already know the files and want a **surgical editor**, not a project manager.

**Trade-off:** Weak for non-code production (images, long research dossiers, multi-product workflows).

### 4.3 Prefer **`grok`** when
- You need **images / UI mockups / short video** without local GPU (e.g. coffee branding UI at ~80% polish).
- You want **fast agent runs** and breadth (parallel workers, prototype-to-demo).
- **Live web / social-adjacent research** should feed directly into action, not only citations.
- One **subscription bundle** (chat + build + imagine) beats paying separately for Claude Max + image + video tools.

**Trade-off:** Weekly usage pool; community still often ranks pure deep coding slightly behind top Claude Code setups; media watermark rules should be re-checked periodically.

## 5. Pros and Cons (Compact)

| Agent | **Pros** | **Cons** |
|-------|----------|----------|
| **`cc`** | Widest orchestration; MCP/ecosystem; strong multi-step engineering posture; DeepSeek can keep cash cost near zero | Heavier; permission model easy to misuse; not best for media; not always the fastest “one-shot” coder |
| **`ds`** | Light, cheap, excellent tight loops; low cognitive overhead; ideal auxiliary coder | Narrow scope; little multimodal; less “team of agents” feel |
| **`grok`** | Multimodal + agents + research in one paid tier; no GPU; high speed/prototype value | Not unlimited; pool drains on agents/media; deep production coding still contested vs Claude Max |

---

## 6. Decision Heuristic (One Screen)

```
Need image / video / UI mock without GPU?     → grok
Need multi-tool project orchestration?       → cc
Need cheap, tight code edit loop only?       → ds
Deep production architecture debate?         → cc first; optional grok second opinion
Live crawl + act in one session?             → grok (or cc if tools already wired)
```

**Recommended default on this phone stack**

| Layer | Default |
|-------|---------|
| Daily coding automation | `cc` |
| Quick patch / secondary loop | `ds` |
| Media + research + fast build | `grok` |

This matches community patterns observed in 2026 discussions: Claude Code for depth and systems; Aider-class tools for thrift; Grok for multimodal and speed-oriented agent breadth—while rejecting the myth of unlimited SuperGrok usage.

## 7. Cost and Limit Notes (Operational)

| Item | Note |
|------|------|
| **`cc` / `ds`** | Dominated by DeepSeek API usage; monitor keys and accidental high token burns |
| **`grok`** | SuperGrok weekly **shared usage pool** (Chat / Build / Imagine / Voice, etc.) — check **Settings → Usage** |
| On pool exhaustion | Free-tier remnants may remain; Extra Credits / Auto Top-up / plan upgrade are the official escapes |
| Watermark | Grok media policy has moved toward visible marks; verify exports rather than assume zero watermark |

---

## 8. Conclusion

The three aliases are best understood as **complementary instruments**:

1. **`cc`** — the **orchestral conductor** (broad agentic engineering).  
2. **`ds`** — the **chamber musician** (precise, economical coding duet).  
3. **`grok`** — the **multimedia ensemble + scout** (vision, media, fast agents, live inquiry).

For a **no-GPU, single-device** operator, keeping all three is rational: DeepSeek-backed `cc`/`ds` control cash cost for code, while SuperGrok pays for capabilities that would otherwise require separate image/video/research subscriptions. Selection should follow **task shape**, not brand loyalty.
